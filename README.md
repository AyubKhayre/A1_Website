### Interest in IT
 
 
**What is your interest in IT?**

I am interested in IT because:

- It is applied throughout society and the everyday life of an individual
 - Most human use technology every day without knowing how it works I want to understand how a how a network or program is constructed.
- The future of IT is limitless and always changing, it excites me to be a part of a fast-paced industry where I will be learning constantly

**When did your Interest in IT start?**

I feel as though I’ve always been fascinated by technology and how computer work. I believe my interest in IT was sparked when I was ten years old when I built my first computer, I remember connecting the Peripherals and CPU to the mother board, after ensuring that the pins were connected the computer came to life.
Furthermore, two years after taking up the role of a Telecommunications technician I understood the basic construct of a network and configuration of router and switches. I wanted to study information technology to learn more about IT.
 I decided to study at RMIT University because it is a globally recognised institution, I also asked my family friends that previously studied at RMIT, and they provided the feedback which led to my enrolment in Online University Australia (OUA).
Throughout my studies I wish to gain knowledge about the information technology industry, how networks and programs are created. I expect to learn how an idea is constructed and the skills required to achieve that idea (e.g. Programming Languages required for certain types of programs).

**What do the results of these tests mean for you?**
 
Each of these tests provide an insight into my personality, leadership and learning

-   Test 1: Myers-Briggs test:
This test provided the most insight into my personality, regarding workplace habits the work that I’m doing must align with my “Values, Principals and beliefs”. Meaning my work must promote some type of growth.
I will be good at working in a group and diffusing bad situations, As an Advocate hierarchy will not be important, I will help my colleagues if they require assistance, however, “there is a risk that others will take advantage of my desire to help.”

-   Test 2: What is you learning style?
Although this test didn’t provide as many details as the other two test it did confirm that I am a visual learner. Meaning I learn best using visual method such as drawing out diagrams using colors and writing down key words and information. The results in this test mean that I must implement visual techniques to learn efficiently.

-  Test 3: Big 5 Personality Test:
For this test I received the personality type “The Traditionalist” ISTJ. This test revealed that I am very “Traditional” and “Detailed oriented”. I scored the highest for sensing (59%) meaning that I am realistic and practical with my expectations. This means that I will be great with feasibility of a project when it comes to time and implementation.

**How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?**

 In a team regardless of my position I will be a team player, assisting my teammates when and if necessary. I will be able to mediate task and solve both group and project-based issues. 
 How should you take this into account when forming a team?

As the Myers – Briggs test states as an advocate I can “find ways to make nearly any position work” for me. I believe I should take this into account when creating a group depending on the personality types of my colleagues.
I should be taking other colleagues' beliefs and goals into account when forming a group however as an advocate I can thrive in any situation and position in a group.



### Project Idea – Raspberry PI Assistant
 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54587856/103129279-49d73980-46ec-11eb-950f-fc183f0563d3.png)



**Overview**

Technology is used throughout our lives in many different forms. Many of ourselves find that we use multiple pieces Technology when at home. The Raspberry Pi assistant will be a very modern but user-friendly piece of technology that will add something to one’s life rather than being another device. 
The Pi home assistant will be a Raspberry Pi that’s connected to a small screen. It will need to be mobile enough to carry around, the PI assistant will display the users google calendar it will display the weather forecast, allow the user to make notes and control home equipment such as smart globes.
 

**Motivation**

The idea of a “PI assistant” is that connectivity is the new normal. My vision is to create a version of a Personal assistant that can help the end user navigate their lives at home especially during this COVID 19 Pandemic were working from home has become the new norm. The Pi assistant will help anyone with the days task ahead. With the use of the raspberry pi, we want to create a small “assistant” that can be developed further in the future to fit a range of features at an affordable price. Using a Raspberry Pi ease of development and affordability will not be an issue.
 
**Description**

The Raspberry Pi assistant will be a personal home assistant that will assist users that are working from home during and after this COVID – 19 period.  
 
 A home assistant is a screen which functions like a tablet or computer and is powered by a lightweight computer (Raspberry Pi) which displays multimedia data to the user.
 
This project will comprise of a Raspberry Pi, a tablet sized screen, smart globes, infrared sensor and camera. The purpose of the home assistant is to provide its user with helpful information that is usually in several places.
 
 The information available to the user will be simple in nature and will inform the user about their day ahead. The standard information that will be displayed on the Raspberry PI home assistant will be:
 
• Users calendar (Daily, weekly, monthly)
• Users notes (Historical and new)
• Front door security (using a wireless camera that’s connected to the end-users home network during this COVID period this is especially helpful to remain COVID safe. Once a courier or delivery driver has left the end-user will be able to safely open their front door)
• Time and Date (Widget that displays time and date in several time zones, this feature will be helpful if the user works with people in different countries)
• Weather and Location (these will be helpful widgets that can be easily added to the smart assistant home page)
 
In addition to these features, the home assistant will allow the user to make notes using the text to speech feature. For the implementation of this feature the programming language python will be required, there are several tutorials which can be found regarding the implementation of this feature.
 
With the use of smart globes, the user will also be able to control their home lighting (color as well as brightness). This is especially helpful if there is or isn’t enough lighting at the users' workstation.
 
The Raspberry Pi home assistant will be a time saver for its end users, displaying all the relevant information required for the day ahead. Using the features outlined above the smart assistant will focus on convenience and ease of use.
 


**Tools and Technologies and technologies required for this project are:**

•	A Raspberry Pi: Small single board computer that’s wireless capable, it will be the main piece of hardware for this project. To enhance usability and reliability the minimum Raspberry Pi Version that will be used will be the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ 
•	Raspberry Pi Infra-Red camera sensor module: An Infra-Red camera attachment for the raspberry pi, this will capture motion  
•	Micro SD card 16g: A general Micro SD card will be used to hold the operating system for the Raspberry Pi
•	Smart light bulb: This will be required to control the lighting using the Raspberry Pi
•	Raspbian: A version of the Debian Linux distribution which has been made for the Raspberry Pi, used as the OS for this project (Raspbian.org 2019)
•	Screen: small to mid-sized screen to display OS

**Skills Required**

In order to complete this Pi home assistant successfully the following skills will be required: 

Set up and use of the Raspberry Pi including using and setting up the Raspbian Operating system (Feasibly: Highly Possible as there are several tutorials online)

•  Using a Unix operating system (Feasibly: Highly Possible due to online tutorials)

•  Basic/Mid-level use of the Terminal (Feasibility: Possible, learning of Linux commands required)

• Connecting additional hardware and components to the Raspberry PI (Feasibility: Highly Possible – Diagram of Raspberry Pi Required e.g., where to connect 
camera and sensor)

• Integrating developed apps with one another (Feasibility: maybe possible depending on the app libraries that are available)

• Use of Python programming language Feasibility: maybe possible depending on the app requirements and skill level required)


**Outcome**

If the project is successful, the outcome of this project will be a working personal assistant. Instead of using multiple devices individuals that are at home or working from home will be able to:
•	Control home lighting using a smart globe
•	See their calendar
•	Make notes with a keyboard and mouse
•	Make notes using speech to text 
•	Users should also be able to stream a wireless camera so they aware of when a package have arrived and to maintain Covid safe practises 
The Pi assistant working from home setup will be a convenient and affordable option for users that are in the market for a home assistant.
